## üíª Project Introduction

### a. Overview

**StudyFlow** is a procrastination-aware task management application designed specifically for Vietnamese university students. The app addresses the daily time management crisis faced by students juggling classes, group projects, part-time work, and personal life across multiple platforms.

The solution provides intelligent task prioritization, procrastination tracking, focus timer integration, and comprehensive analytics to help students better manage their time and navigate the chaos of student life.

### b. Key Features & Function Manual

**Core Features:**
- **Task Management**: Full CRUD operations for tasks with categories (Assignment & Class, Group Project, Part-time Work, Life & Personal)
- **Smart Prioritization**: Tasks sorted by priority (high/medium/low) and due dates
- **Multi-View Interface**: 
  - Task List View: Complete task management with filtering and search
  - Calendar View: Visual timeline of tasks and deadlines
  - Analytics View: Productivity insights and completion trends
- **Procrastination Tracking**: Automatic detection and scoring of delayed tasks
- **Focus Timer**: Pomodoro-style timer with task linking to track actual work time
- **Data Persistence**: Local storage with export/import functionality

**How to Use:**
1. Add tasks using the "Add Task" button with title, description, category, priority, and due date
2. Use the focus timer to track time spent on specific tasks
3. View tasks in different perspectives: List, Calendar, or Analytics
4. Monitor procrastination patterns and get improvement suggestions
5. Filter tasks by category, priority, or status for better organization

### c. Unique Features (What's special about this app?) 

**Procrastination Intelligence:**
- Automatic procrastination scoring based on postponements and delay patterns
- Smart suggestions for improvement based on user behavior
- Category-specific procrastination insights (which types of tasks you delay most)

**Student-Centric Design:**
- Pre-configured categories matching Vietnamese student life (Assignment & Class, Group Project, Part-time Work, Life & Personal)
- Focus timer integration that learns your actual work patterns vs estimates
- Analytics that show productivity trends and help identify peak performance times

**Integrated Time Tracking:**
- Links focus sessions directly to tasks for accurate time measurement
- Tracks estimated vs actual completion time to improve future planning
- Comprehensive analytics showing work patterns and completion rates

**Smart Data Visualization:**
- Three distinct views of the same data to match different planning styles
- Calendar integration showing deadline collisions and scheduling conflicts
- Real-time analytics dashboard with actionable insights

### d. Technology Stack and Implementation Methods

**Frontend Framework:**
- **React 19** - Modern component-based UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development with strict mode enabled
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server

**UI & Styling:**
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **Radix UI** - Accessible, unstyled UI components (dialogs, tabs, forms)
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful, customizable icon library
- **Class Variance Authority** - For component variant management

**Data Management:**
- **LocalStorage API** - Client-side persistent data storage
- Custom storage layer with full CRUD operations and data validation
- JSON serialization with versioning for data integrity

**Development Tools:**
- **ESLint** - Code linting with React and TypeScript rules
- **TypeScript ESLint** - Enhanced TypeScript linting
- Path aliases (`@/`) for clean import statements

### e. Service Architecture & Database structure (when used)

**Client-Side Architecture:**
- **Single Page Application (SPA)** with component-based architecture
- **Central State Management** through `TaskManagement.tsx` component
- **Modular Storage Layer** (`storage.ts`) handling all data operations

**Data Structure (LocalStorage JSON):**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "data": {
    "tasks": [...],           // Task entities with full metadata
    "categories": [...],       // Task categorization system  
    "procrastinationData": [...], // Delay tracking and scoring
    "focusSessions": [...],   // Pomodoro timer sessions
    "settings": {...}         // User preferences and config
  },
  "lastModified": "ISO_DATE"
}
```

**Key Data Models:**
- **Task**: ID, title, description, category, priority, status, dates, time tracking
- **FocusSession**: Timer sessions linked to specific tasks for accurate time measurement  
- **ProcrastinationData**: Postponement tracking with automatic delay calculations
- **Analytics**: Real-time computed metrics from stored data

**No Backend Required:** All functionality implemented client-side with localStorage persistence, making deployment simple and data private.

## üß† Reflection

### a. If you had more time, what would you expand?
